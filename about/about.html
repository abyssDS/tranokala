			<p><h2>About me</h2></p>
			<p>My name is Ando Landy. I started to make stuff in electronics when I was 9 years old. I remember I trip our home power source for my experience, I wasn't aware about the voltage.</p>
			<p>second, at 15 years studying mechanical as an apprentis, I extended my knowledge in electicity. In the same time I discover a new world with the informatics. I found the art of photography and the postproduction, it's exactly a graphics. And also curious in programming (software). But due developpement of the informatics and the internet, getting an internet is really difficult in that time, only privilege can afford. </p>
