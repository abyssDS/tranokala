			<p><h2>About me</h2></p>
			<p>I am born as a technician, started to make stuff in electronics when I was 9 years old. I remember, I cut off our home power source because of my experience, I wasn't aware about the voltage yet.</p>
			<p>second, at 15 years studying mechanical as an apprenti, I extended my knowledge in electicity. In the same time I discover a new world with the informatics. I found the art of photography and the postproduction. And also curious in programming (software). But due getting access of informatics and the internet in my place,(getting an internet is really difficult in that time,) only privilege can afford. I was not able to extend my knowledge further.</p>
			<p>Now, performing my study in programming and photography(communication art), I extend to relate programming and electronics which is now expand every day.</p>
			<p>Related with Artificial Intelligence, I want to discover the new world.</p>
